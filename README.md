Graceful degredation makes sure that a web app is still functional without some features that are considered advanced. Service workers make the app more functional and reliable because they provide offline support and maintain the basic functionalities of the app even if there are some issues. Basically, service workers make graceful degredation easier to occur because they are resilient to errors and loss of capability in delivering all features.
